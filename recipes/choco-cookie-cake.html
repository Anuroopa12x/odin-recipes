    <h2><ins>Directions</ins></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Make the crust: Combine cookie crumbs, brown sugar, melted butter,
             and cinnamon in a medium bowl; firmly press mixture evenly onto the bottom and 
             1 inch up the sides of a 10-inch springform pan. 
            Bake in the preheated oven for 5 minutes; set aside.</li>
        <li>Prepare the cheesecake: Beat cream cheese in a large bowl until smooth. Gradually mix in 1 1/4 cups sugar, 
            heavy whipping cream, flour, and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Beat in eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition.
             Pour 1/3 of the batter into the prepared pan.
             Top with cookie pieces; pour in remaining batter.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove cake from the oven.</li>
        <li>Combine sour cream, remaining 1/4 cup sugar, and remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla; spread evenly on cheesecake.
             Continue baking for 7 minutes. Turn oven off, leaving cheesecake in for an additional 30 minutes.
             Remove cheesecake and let cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
        <li>Make the chocolate topping: Combine chocolate chips and heavy
             whipping cream in a saucepan; stir over low heat until chocolate melts, then stir in vanilla.
             Pour mixture over cheesecake while still warm.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate before serving, at least 8 hours or overnight.
             Remove about 1/2 hour to 1 hour before serving and remove the ring from the springform pan.</li>
    </ol>
